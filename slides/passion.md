## Be Passionate

note:

By and far, the number one trait I've seen shared among the best developers I know is a passion for what they do.

Give me a passionate junior developer over a grizzled, bitter senior any day.

If I won the lottery and never had to work again, I'd *still* be writing software, just the software I *want* to write.
