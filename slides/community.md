## Be a Positive Force in your Community


note:

If you look around the room, you'll see that we're not all alike; we come from a range of backgrounds, experiences. We don't all fit into the stereotypical model of a programmer, and that's a great thing.

Cliché, but be the change you want to see. Help others. Speak. Become a mentor.

Some of my best growth experiences have been while talking to people who saw me as the expert.
